            I think that smartphones don't need to be used in the classrooms at all. There is no need and it is distracting. In one of my classes, people put their phone in front of their laptop screens (so it can't be seen) and wear wireless earphones (so they're less noticable) to watch Netflix or something unrelated. I think it is disrespectful and a waste of education. It is distracting to people around and to themselves. School is a place to learn and phones make it worse. Some people can't afford phones and may not have a phone so it's not great to them. Using phones during class is irresponsible of a students' own learning. Even if they are told not to, they'll do it anyway. <br> 

        <br> It can be useful in the sense that students check their timetable or time, but there are usually clocks in the classroom and we have two classes and then a break. In the break, they can check their next two classes and remember those instead of looking at class time. It is more of a distraction than a help. School is where you're meant to learn. Phones do the oppposite of helping learn. In this day, a lot of poeple have social media and check it constatnly. This is something they can do during intervals or before and after school. People need breaks from their phones. Sometimes we get caught up in the world of phones and internet, we forget about the real world. The world is dying and there's no denying it. Global warming and problems are affecting our world already. The next generation, those at school, are the ones who are gonna have to save it before it's too late. How can we do that if we can't even focus in class?

            <br>
            They say that taking phones away improved students with bad grades. "We found the impact of banning phones for these students equivalent to an additional hour a week in school, or to increasing the school year by five days." I think that this proves a point. School is for learning.

            <a href="http://www.collegedegrees.com/blog/2011/01/28/negative-effects-of-smartphones-in-the-classroom/"> This website agrees with me. </a> 
            <br>
            They say that 'In fact, cellular phones were an early problem when students were distracted by phone calls and texts messaging, but now smartphones can do just about anything your computer or laptop can, but in an easily concealable handheld device' which shows they think it's a growing problem. 
            <a href="https://www.techwalla.com/articles/negative-effects-of-cell-phones-on-education"> This website agrees with me.</a>
            <br>
            They believe that phones affect sleep patterns, are distractng in class and 'Cell phones have been used to call in bomb threats'. I agree with this because nobody can control students using their phones other than the students themselves. Cellphones can lead to problems like these.

            <br> This website thinks that smartphones in classrooms are good because it can be used to 'access to the internet for research and referencing, access to e-mail, the ability to snap a picture of the dayâ€™s homework assignment scribbled on a whiteboard or take a short video of a key lecture moment, apps like Evernote to store, catalog, and annotate smartphone photos, recording lectures with Voice Memo and other third-party note-taking apps, keeping track of schedules and dates'. I disagree because you don't need a phone. Most schools have computers for internet or email etc. Taking photos and recording can be a bad thing becuase it could be used as a form of bullying against other students. They can write to take notes like that. It has been done before in the class and can be done again.

            They say taking phones away from students could cause them anxiety and could impact on their grades. I think that if people are that attached to their phones, that's a problem. How's their phone going to do to 'calm their anxiety' if they used it in class and were in an exam where no phones are allowed and they don't know anything because of that? And what about the 'anxiety' of people who don't have/use phones and feel left out? I personally think that phones can only help with anxiety during intervals. It is good for people who don't have anyone to speak to have some way of feeling that there is something for them. That is 'calming their anxiety'. But during class is not okay because in that lesson, there might be something that is beneficial to them. I don't see any way that phones can cause anxiety. I think they increase anxiety because social media is such a powerful thing. People worry about other people that aren't involved in their life. A phone is a communciation tool. Not anything but that.

            <br> 
            They see cellphones good for educational learning apps, help students who aren't that confident to join in group discussions digitally without having to speak, research online and are an easy way of accessing the internet and information convinently. Although these are good points, this can all be done by computers. Most school have computers nowadays. Phones aren't that great because wifi isn't usually given to phones so students would have to use their own data to do these things which can get expensive. Parents already pay a lot for schools who provide internet to computers and to have computers and this is not using the oppurtunity they have been given.
